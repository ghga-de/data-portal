  <p>Thank you for registering in the GHGA data portal.</p>
  <p>
    For additional security when accessing protected data with the GHGA data portal, we
    are using two-factor authentication and verification of your identity via a contact
    address that is separate from your primary E-Mail contact address.
  </p>
  <button mat-raised-button (click)="confirmRegistration()">Continue</button>
} @else if (hasLostToken() && !lostTokenConfirmed()) {
  <p>
    In the case that you lost your phone or the setup of your authenticator app, you can
    create a new authentication code setup.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, all contact addresses that had been verified before will need to be
    verified again.
  </p>
  <button mat-raised-button (click)="lostTokenConfirmed.set(true)">Continue</button>
  <button mat-button (click)="cancelLostToken()">Cancel</button>

  @if (uri) {
    <p>
      The two-factor authentication means that we require you to enter an additional
      6-digit authentication code after you logged in via LS Login. This code can be
      produced by an authenticator app such as Aegis, Microsoft Authenticator or Google
      Authenticator, which you can install on your mobile phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to set up the authenticator app to produce the authentication codes for
      the GHGA data portal, please scan this QR code with your authenticator app:
    </p>
    <qrcode [qrdata]="uri" [width]="160"></qrcode>
    <button mat-button (click)="showManualSetup = !showManualSetup">
      @if (showManualSetup) {
        Hide
      } @else {
        Show
      }
      manual setup instructions
    </button>
    @if (showManualSetup) {
      <p>
        If you have trouble scanning the QR Code, please manually input the following
        setup key in your authenticator app:
      </p>
      <p><input type="text" size="35" readonly [value]="getSecret(uri)" /></p>
      <button mat-button (click)="copySecret(uri)">Copy the setup key</button>
    }
    <button mat-raised-button (click)="completeSetup()">Continue</button>
  } @else if (uri === undefined) {
    <p>Generating the TOTP setup...</p>
  } @else {
    <p>Error setting up two-factor authentication.</p>
    <p><a routerLink="/">Go back to the home page.</a></p>
